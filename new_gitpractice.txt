Dear Internet,

How I love you so much! I have been able to do so many things because of you, learn through you from others, spend hours being unto no good watching videos and doing mindless searches. My love affair with you befgghhgghhgvvghgit@github.com:fharzana/codingdojo.gitgan some 13 years ago and it is still going strong. Now I'm trying to learn how to make web applications for you. Now I'll save this file, so that I can learn to use Git, one of your wonderful children. 

Talk to you soon, Internet! 

Lovingly yours,
Fharzana
